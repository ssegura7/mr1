                <li>low-level languages</li>
                <li>assembly languages</li>
                <li>high-level languages</li>

            <h2>High-Level Languages</h2>
            <p>When we think about computer programmers, we are probably thinking about people who write in <strong>high-level programming languages</strong></p>
            <p><strong>High-level languages</strong> are written in a form that is close to our human language, enabling to programmer to just focus on the problem being solved.</p>
            <p><em>Examples include</em>: C, C++, Java, Pascal, Python, Visual Basic.</p>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Easier to modify as it uses English like statements</li>
                <li>Easier/faster to write code as it uses English like statements</li>
                <li>Easier to debug during development due to English like statements</li>
                <li>Portable code – not designed to run on just one type of machine</li>
            </ol>

            <p> SQL is a personal favorite because of its syntax and usefulness in everyday life for a lot of occupations. SQL is a language fit for database management. It allows for extraction and organization of data stored in a database for analysis. Its ability to retrieve, insert, update, and delete records is valuable in a day and age where almost all information is stored on a database.</p>
